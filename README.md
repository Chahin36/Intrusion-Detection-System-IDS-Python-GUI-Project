🔐 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – Python GUI Project

This project is a Python-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with a graphical user interface that monitors network activity, detects suspicious behavior, and allows attack simulation to test the system’s effectiveness.

It is designed for educational and academic purposes, helping students understand how IDS systems work in practice.
